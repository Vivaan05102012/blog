          sightseeing. The lake is home to three tiny islands that can be reached by boat. The islands are a popular
          tourist attraction and offer many exciting activities.

          Visiting it offers a chance to pay homage to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives in World War I. The
          iconic structure, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, showcases exquisite architecture and stands as a memorial to
          the Unknown Soldier. Surrounding lawns provide a serene atmosphere for reflection, making it a popular spot
          for both locals and tourists. The evening illumination adds a touch of grandeur, enhancing the overall

        <p> I watched "Tiger Zinda Hai" for the first time in January 2022, and I ended up watching it 10 more times for
          several reasons. The intense and well-executed action sequences really grabbed my attention, making me crave
          those adrenaline-pumping moments over and over. The dynamic chemistry between Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif,
          coupled with their commendable performances, added a lot to the movie's rewatch value. The gripping plot,
          revolving around espionage and a mission to save hostages, kept me on the edge of my seat, making it
          worthwhile to revisit and catch any missed nuances. The emotional connection with the characters, their
          charisma, and relatable journey resonated with me on different levels. Lastly, the high production values,
          impressive cinematography, and captivating soundtrack created an immersive cinematic experience that I found
          irresistible, prompting multiple viewings.</p>

        </h5>
        <p>I recently watched Dabangg 3 and found it to be a mixed bag of entertainment. Salman Khan's charismatic
          portrayal of Chulbul Pandey continues to be the film's strength, bringing his signature swagger and humor to
          the forefront. The action sequences are high-octane and visually appealing, showcasing Salman's prowess as an
          action hero. However, the film falters in its predictable storyline and lack of innovation. While the music
          adds a touch of nostalgia with the reprised version of some iconic tracks, overall, the soundtrack fails to
          leave a lasting impression. Dabangg 3 is a treat for Salman Khan fans who enjoy his larger-than-life persona,
          but it falls short in delivering a fresh and engaging narrative.</p>

        </h5>
        <p>"I watched Tiger 3 recently and I must say that it was a thrilling experience. The movie is directed by
          Maneesh Sharma and stars Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles. The story revolves around Tiger
          (Salman Khan) and his partner Zoya (Katrina Kaif) who face a personal threat when a vengeful terrorist from
          Pakistan issues an ultimatum. The movie is packed with constant thrills, plot twists, and high-octane action
          sequences. Salman Khan looks fresh and back in perfect form, performing dare-devil stunts that not only defy
          death and gravity but also logic. Katrina Kaif gets a well-defined character arc with a convincing backstory,
          a solid motive, and context. She pulls off an action-heavy role with ease, kicking some serious butt. The
          movie is a good addition to the franchise with enough ammo for mass entertainment. However, the dialogues lack
          the punch to evoke constant applause and seetis from Bhai fans. Despite such heavy dependence on VFX, ‘Tiger
          3’ lacks the required finesse in many scenes, much like its jarring background score. Overall, I would
          recommend this movie to anyone who loves action-packed thrillers.</p>

      <h4>UK Surpasses 50% Renewable Energy Milestone: A Giant Leap Towards Sustainable Leadership</h4>
      <img src="Greenengland.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" >
      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >In a significant step towards a greener future, the United Kingdom has achieved a remarkable milestone in its commitment to renewable energy. The latest data reveals that renewable sources now contribute to over 50% of the country's total energy consumption, marking a substantial leap from previous years.
        <br>

      Government initiatives, such as increased investment in wind and solar projects, have played a pivotal role in driving this positive change. The expansion of offshore wind farms, in particular, has bolstered the UK's renewable energy capacity. Experts predict that this achievement not only reduces the nation's carbon footprint but also positions it as a global leader in sustainable energy practices.
        <br>
      Environmentalists and policymakers alike are lauding the efforts made to transition away from fossil fuels. The positive impact on air quality, wildlife habitats, and overall environmental health is evident. As the UK continues to embrace cleaner energy alternatives, this milestone serves as a beacon of hope for a brighter and more sustainable future.</p>

     <h4>Rising Air Pollution Threatens UK's Environmental Health</h4>
     <img src="Badthing.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12" >
     <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >The United Kingdom faces a critical environmental challenge as air pollution levels surge, causing widespread concern among experts. Increased industrial activities, traffic congestion, and adverse weather conditions contribute to the deterioration of air quality, particularly in major cities. The detrimental impact on public health, especially among vulnerable populations, underscores the urgent need for government intervention. Calls for stricter regulations on emissions and a shift towards sustainable transportation underscore the gravity of the situation, emphasizing the pressing need for collective efforts to address and mitigate the escalating air pollution crisis.</p>
